            <h2>Hi, welcome to my personal website!</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Karina Pliego, it's great to meet you!
                I received my Bachelor's degree at the College of the 
                Holy Cross in May 2021. During my time there, I studied 
                Math and Philosophy and shortly after found my interest 
                in Computer Science. I've created projects in Java, 
                Python, and now, HTML, CSS and Javascript!
